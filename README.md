### b. Start the ONOS and Mininet dockers

We have provided a `Makefile` containing the commands needed to run Mininet, ONOS, and other configurations. Open four separate command shells and `cd` into the `assignment0` folder.

* In the first shell, **start ONOS**:

```sh
$ cd 2022-fall-536-project
$ make controller
```

This will start the ONOS controller. You will see a lot of information printed on the terminal; wait until it stops -- and it will stop!

* In the second terminal, **start Mininet**:

```sh
$ cd 2022-fall-536-project
$ make mininet nhost=6
```

Once started, you will see the `mininet>` prompt. This indicates that your virtual network is ready and running, and you can now issue commands through this prompt.

This will give us a topology looks like host 2,3,...,n --- switch 1 --- switch 2 --- host 1, you can change the parameter nhost to choose the number clients in one side of the switch. 

Let's try listing the hosts and switches in this network and their connectivity. Enter ...

```sh
mininet> net
```

Output:
```
mininet> net
h1 h1-eth0:s2-eth2

h2 h2-eth0:s1-eth1

h3 h3-eth0:s1-eth2

h4 h4-eth0:s1-eth3

h5 h5-eth0:s1-eth4

h6 h6-eth0:s1-eth5

s1 lo:  s1-eth1:h2-eth0 s1-eth2:h3-eth0 s1-eth3:h4-eth0 s1-eth4:h5-eth0 s1-eth5:h6-eth0 s1-eth6:s2-eth1

s2 lo:  s2-eth1:s1-eth6 s2-eth2:h1-eth0
```

This shows three nodes in this network: `h1`, `h2`, and `s1`. For `h1` and `h2`, their `eth0` interface is connected to switch `s1` `eth1` and `eth2` interfaces, respecitvely.

> **Note:** Visit [http://mininet.org/walkthrough/](http://mininet.org/walkthrough/) to learn more about Mininet and the various commands you can run inside it.

If you try pinging the two hosts (`h1` and `h2`) in Mininet, you will see that the pings won't follow through. From the second terminal, for Mininet, run ...

```sh
mininet> h1 ping -c 4 h2
```

It's because the switch `s1`, at the moment, doesn't know how to route the incoming packets. For that, we will have to connect switch `s1` to the ONOS controller and run a network application (`fwd`) in ONOS that will instruct the switch where to route these packets.

* In the third terminal, **start ONOS CLI**:

To activate the network application `fwd`, start the ONOS command-line interface (CLI) from the third terminal.

```sh
$ cd 2022-fall-536-project
$ make cli 
```

It will prompt a password, which is `rocks` ... and ONOS clearly ROCKS!

Once started, you will see the `onos@root >` prompt. To activate `fwd`, run ...

```sh
onos@root > app activate fwd
```

Output:
``` sh
onos@root > app activate fwd
Activated org.onosproject.fwd
```

> **Note:** Visit [https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/The+ONOS+CLI](https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/The+ONOS+CLI) to learn various commands that ONOS CLI currently supports. You will find them handy when working on your assignments.

* In the fourth terminal, **run ONOS netcfg** script:

Now, let the ONOS controller know of switch `s1` by passing it the `public/assignments/assignment0/cfg/netcfg.json` file using the `onos-netcfg` script. The JSON file tells the controller through which ip:port to connect to `s1`.

From the fourth terminal, run ...

```sh
$ cd 2022-fall-536-project
$ make netcfg
```

You will see some updates printed on the first terminal, where ONOS is running. Ignore `ERROR`; it's a bug (or typo) in ONOS.

- And then in the same terminal, install Mininet prerequisites and dependencies. (Make sure Mininet is running in another terminal before executing this command).
```sh
$ cd 2022-fall-536-project
$ make mininet-prereqs
```

### c. Start the multi-client test
We first clean the workspace and compile the client and server code.
```sh
$ cd 2022-fall-536-project
$ make clean
$ make client-server
```

Then we can run the scripts to let at most $nhost - 1$ clients concurrently sent message to the server. The following script will let host h2 send $nbits=10$ bits to host h1 and test the client code both in C code and python code. 
```sh
$ make tests nhost=2 nbits=10
```

Recall we build a mininet with 6 host, that is one server on one side and 5 clients on the other side, you can run at least $nhost=2$ and at most $nhost=6$ in the above code.

If you want to test only the C code client, please run the following
```sh
$ make -f Congestion_Tests.mak tests-c nhost=2 nbits=100
```

and for only the python code client, run the following
```sh
$ make -f Congestion_Tests.mak tests-python nhost=2 nbits=100
```

To check the message sent and received, at the project root directory, do the following
```sh
$ cd .workspace/
```
and you can find files like the below.
```
test_message_2.txt  test_message_4.txt  test_message_6.txt
test_message_3.txt  test_message_5.txt  test_output.text
```

For more information please check the Make files
```
Makefile 
Congestion_Tests.mak
```
scripts
```
./scripts/project
```
and mininet configuration files
```
./cfg/topo-2sw-nhost.py
```

### d. Warning
In fact, you will find when running 
```sh
$ make -f Congestion_Tests.mak tests-python nhost=3 nbits=100
```
the cmd will be stuck, this is because server C code now can accept one client each time and Python client code is too slow (may have bug) to send message. Please correct those code to suit our goal.
